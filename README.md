Short description of the code :

First question:
There are two classes in the code: Employee and FulltimeEmployee. 
The Employee class serves as a base class with attributes for employee details, a counter for the number of employees, and a method to calculate the average salary. The FulltimeEmployee class inherits from Employee and introduces an additional attribute for the company name.
Instances of both classes are created (emp1, emp2, emp3 for Employee and adi for FulltimeEmployee). Various methods are called, such as calculating the average salary, displaying employee details, setting and getting the company name for a full-time employee, and displaying the total number of employees.

Second question:
Imports the NumPy library (np).
Creates a NumPy vector of size 20 containing floating-point numbers in the range 1 to 20 using np.arange(). And
Reshapes the vector into a 4 by 5 matrix using the reshape() function.
Replace Maximum in Each Row with 0:
It identifies the maximum value in each row using np.max(axis=1).
Uses np.where() to replace these maximum values with 0.And the resulting modified matrix is printed.
